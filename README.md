# ShakeIt 
**ShakeIt** is a mobile app for searching and creating cocktails. The app's logic is written in **Swift**, while its UI is built using **SwiftUI**. The [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) API is used as the source for predefined cocktails and available ingredients.

Once a day, the user can randomly draw the "Drink of the Day" by shaking their phone, triggering a fun animation with haptic feedback. Cocktails can be saved to favorites and easily shared. The application schedules notifications to inform user about new "Drink of the Day" cocktails.

Unit Tests as well as the automated UI testing is performed via XCTest framework. The application supports Polish 🇵🇱 and English 🇬🇧 language via localizations.
